### Button Press

This example shows how to assign a custom key mapping to an object.  In this case it's a cube.  If the cube is held and the primary button on the controller is pressed, the cube will change color.  Only the button on the controller holding the object will activate the color change.  If the cube is dropped, the cube will not change color.
